What it's like to hold your data in your arms

## Baseline

When working with the L1000 dataset in a server environment I always felt something was missing.  Like I was locked out of a room.  The goal of interlinked is to enable fluid, seamless analysis of the LINCS L1000 dataset at scale leveraging the AWS Batch environment. It also provides a simple template for running R based analyses on AWS batch triggered by Lambda events. To find out all the answers to all the questions. Interlinked.

At this point, this is just a blood black darkness beginning to spin. Is that a metaphor? Interlinked.
